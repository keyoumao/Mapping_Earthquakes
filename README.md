# Mapping_Earthquakes

Data of earthquakes in tectonic plates over the past 7 days.

## Introduction

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) (https://www.usgs.gov/) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. They develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. I have built a set of tools that will allow visualization of USGS earthquake data. This app is intended for displaying the earthquake data: illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates, which could attract potential funding agencies or industrial sponsors to support rearch on improving our planet.
